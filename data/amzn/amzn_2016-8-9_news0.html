data-reactid="227">It was hard to imagine life getting better for longtime Trekkie <strong><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/people/jeff-bezos#intcid=dt-hot-link">Jeff Bezos</a></strong> than when he <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/jeff-bezos-star-trek-costume">made his Hollywood debut</a> in the latest <em>Star Trek</em> movie last month. But that was before he went and sold 1 million Amazon shares last week for $757 million, according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872416000292/xslF345X03/wf-form4_147035040433988.xml">a regulatory filing</a>, a record amount for the founder and C.E.O.</p><p data-reactid="228">Being a multi-billionaire on paper is nice, but cash on hand is nicer. As it happens, in the last three months alone, Bezos has cashed in on $1.4 billion worth of Amazon shares, including the 1 million shares he offloaded for $671 million in May. Both sales occurred just after Amazon reported strong quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations and boosted the e-commerce giant&#x2019;s stock price, which has leapt 45 percent in the last year. It&#x2019;s not as though Bezos is in a panic to get rid of the shares while they&#x2019;re hot or do anything untoward; according to the regulatory filing, Bezos was on a set schedule to get rid of 1 million shares just after each quarter. If the results hadn&#x2019;t been so good and the stock price wasn&#x2019;t so high, he still would have had to make the sale.</p><p data-reactid="229">But the reality is that online sales have been strong and its cloud software business is soaring. As a result, Amazon recently overtook Exxon Mobil to become the fourth-most-valuable U.S. company based on market cap. Bezos himself leapfrogged over <strong><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/people/warren-buffett#intcid=dt-hot-link">Warren Buffett</a></strong> to become the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/jeff-bezos-worlds-third-richest-man">third-richest man</a> in the world, behind only <strong><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/people/bill-gates#intcid=dt-hot-link">Bill Gates</a></strong> and <strong>Amancio Ortega.</strong></p><p data-reactid="230">A company on a tear and $1.4 billion in the bank is great. For Bezos, something tells us that donning a craggy alien costume on the <em>Star Trek</em> set was better.</p><div class="players-cta" data-reactid="231"><div class="players-cta__people" data-reactid="232"><div class="players-cta__person" style="background-image:url(https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57436e05c1f81aa45c8117ef/master/pass/hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg);" data-reactid="233"><div class="players-cta__name" data-reactid="234"><a href="/people/jeff-bezos" data-reactid="235">Jeff  Bezos</a></div><div data-player-name="jeff -bezos" data-reactid="236"><div class="component-follow-button players-cta__follow effect follow" data-reactid="237"><div class="button" data-reactid="238"><span class="icon" data-reactid="239"></span><span class="title" data-reactid="240">FOLLOW</span></div></div></div></div><div class="players-cta__person" style="background-image:url(https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57477277b1a9903a488276e4/master/pass/hive-contributor-profile-warren-buffett.jpg);" data-reactid="241"><div class="players-cta__name" data-reactid="242"><a href="/people/warren-buffett" data-reactid="243">Warren  Buffett</a></div><div data-player-name="warren -buffett" data-reactid="244"><div class="component-follow-button players-cta__follow effect follow" data-reactid="245"><div class="button" data-reactid="246"><span class="icon" data-reactid="247"></span><span class="title" data-reactid="248">FOLLOW</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="players-cta__promo" data-reactid="249"><p class="players-cta__promo-text" data-reactid="250">Follow to get the latest news and analysis about the players in your inbox.</p><a class="players-cta__promo-link" style="color:#FFF;" href="/people" data-reactid="251">See All Players</a></div></div><div data-reactid="252"><div class="embed slideshow article-slideshow-embed row" id="embed-gallery-577ffe153acd1f4426d7aa20" data-type="slideshow"><div class="slideshow-container embed"><div><div class="embed-title"><a href="/news/photos/2016/07/most-stylish-shades-sun-valley-conference" class="embed-enlarge">Full Screen</a><strong class="label">Photos:</strong><div class="component-counter" data-component="Counter"><div class="counter"><span class="current">1</span><span class="divider">/</span><span class="total">12</span></div></div><span class="embed-dek">The Most Stylish Shades From the Sun Valley Conference</span></div><div class="embed-slideshow-container first-slide"><div class="slick-initialized slick-slider"><div class="slick-list"><div class="slick-track"><div class="slick-slide slick-active slick-cloned" data-index="0" style="outline:none;position:relative;left:0;opacity:1;transition:opacity 0ms ease;-webkit-transition:opacity 0ms ease;" tabindex="-1" title=""><div class="slideshow-slide"><div class="slideshow-slide-photo"><div class="slideshow-slide-photo-image"><div class="component-photo"><div class="component-rendition" data-aspect-ratio="master" data-component="Rendition"><div class="component-image pending" style="height:590px;" data-component="Image"><img alt="Shari Redstone, the First Lady of the Redstone empire, sports a modern Jackie Onasis look." src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/577ffe6a3acd1f4426d7aa21/master/h_590,c_limit/sun-valley-conference-sunglasses-2016-01.jpg"></div></div></div></div><div class="embed-info-text"><h2 class="title"></h2><div class="caption">Shari Redstone, the First Lady of the Redstone empire, sports a modern Jackie Onasis look.</div><cite>Photo: By Drew Angerer/Getty Images.</cite></div></div></div></div><div class="slick-slide slick-cloned" data-index="1" style="outline:none;position:relative;left:0;opacity:0;transition:opacity 0ms ease;-webkit-transition:opacity 0ms ease;" tabindex="-1" title=""><div class="slideshow-slide"><div class="slideshow-slide-photo"><div class="slideshow-slide-photo-image"><div class="component-photo"><div class="component-rendition" data-aspect-ratio="master" data-component="Rendition"><div class="component-image pending" style="height:590px;" data-component="Image"><img alt="Coca-Cola C.E.O.

Shaw in New York City. He was astounded to learn about the growth of the Internet&#8212;2,400 percent a year. Bezos decided he had to find a way to take advantage of the demand. He made a list of what he should sell online, eventually settling on books. Along with his wife, MacKenzie, Bezos drove across the country to Seattle, making revenue projections for his company the whole time. In 1994, he incorporated the company as Cadabra but switched to Amazon after a lawyer misheard the original name as âcadaver.â In 1995, Bezos sold the first book  on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.</em> When Bezos took Amazon public, in 1997, it was an unusual public offering for a tech company at the time. Amazon went public before it ever turned a profit. Bezos didnât expect Amazon to be profitable for several years.\n<p>Bezos popularized online shopping, and even when the dot-com bubble killed off many e-commerce companies, Amazon thrived. Amazon shares have only increased over time, and the company sells everything from clothes and music to cloud-computing services. Amazon has launched a smartphone and TV-streaming box. The company has revolutionized logistics, even reportedly leasing its own planes to move Amazon merchandise, so itâs no longer at the mercy of third-party shippers.</p>\n<p>But Amazon isnât Bezosâs only endeavor.

According to securities filings <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/jeff-bezos-richest-man.html?_r=0\">reviewed</a> by <em>The New York Times,</em> Bezos owns almost 81 million shares of Amazon, or 17 percent of the company (other investments include <em>The Washington Post,</em> or as President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> calls it, â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/889672374458646528\">the Amazon Washington Post</a>,â and rocket company Blue Origin, which Bezos <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/science/blue-origin-rocket-jeff-bezos-amazon-stock.html\">sells about $1 billion of Amazon stock a year</a> to fund). Last month, Amazon announced that in its ongoing quest for world domination, it had struck a deal with Whole Foods <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition\">to buy the grocery chain for $13.7 billion</a>, a move that could not have come <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/blue-apron-shares-fall\">at a worse time</a> for meal-kit delivery service Blue Apron.</p>\n<p>If Gates is feeling bad about losing the Worldâs Richest title, he can comfort himself with the fact that, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2017/07/27/jeff-bezos-overtakes-bill-gates-to-become-worlds-richest-man/#165617c2791c\">according to <em>Forbes</em></a>, itâs only because heâs been so generous in giving away his money:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bezos would be nowhere close to being the worldâs wealthiest person had Gates not given so much of his fortune to philanthropy. Gates, who created the Giving Pledge with Buffett to encourage billionaires to give at least half of their wealth to charitable causes, had given away $31.1 billion over the course of his lifetime through [the] end of 2016. <em>Forbes</em> estimates that Bezos, who has not signed the pledge, had given approximately $100 million to charity through the end of 2015. In June, Bezos tweeted out a request for ideas for his philanthropy, garnering thousands of responses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bezosâs newfound supremacy comes at a politically precarious moment for the billionaire, who has often found himself in the presidentâs crosshairs. While Trump made clear his feelings about the frequently critical <em>Washington Post</em> during the campaign, since taking office heâs increased his attacks on both Amazon and Bezos, tweeting about how Amazon doesnât pay â<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/trump-threatens-to-tax-the-internet-because-hes-mad-at-jeff-bezos\">internet taxes</a>â and repeatedly tweeting about Amazon and the <em>Post</em> in the same breath (e.g., <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/889672374458646528\">âThe Amazon Washington Post fabricated the factsâ</a>) as if they were one company, and not two distinct companies owned by the same man. Considering Trumpâs affinity for talking about how rich he is while simultaneously <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-michael-bloomberg-net-worth-2016-1\">claiming much richer billionaires couldnât possibly be as wealthy as they are reported to be</a>, it wouldnât seem too out of character for him to threaten Amazonâs acquisition of Whole Foods, especially if he thought it might put some fear into the <em>Post.</em> (The White House has <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/donald-trump-cnn-time-warner-merger\">reportedly</a> discussed using the pending merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, parent company of Trump adversary CNN, as âa potential point of leverage.â)</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/889675644396867584\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/889675644396867584\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/889675644396867584</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Democrats may be growing weary of Bezos, too: the partyâs <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/democrats-new-economic-message-anti-trust\">populist new economic message</a> specifically focuses on cracking down on corporate monopolies, and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/democrats-message-populist-monopolies-congress-trump/534603/\">promises</a> to create âa 21st-century âTrust Busterâ to stop abusive corporate conduct and the exploitation of market power.â Already, New Jersey Senator and potential 2020 hopeful <strong>Cory Booker</strong> has raised concerns about the Amazon-Whole Foods merger, telling Recode last week, âThis consolidation thatâs happening all over the country is not a positive trend.â</p>\n<p>While a drop in Amazonâs stock could temporarily bring Bezos back down to lowly No. 2, CNBC <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/27/jeff-bezos-is-set-to-become-the-worlds-richest-man.html\">predicts</a> it would be only a matter of time before the tech chief was back on top for good:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . . even if Bezos doesnât end the day as the richest man, he will likely take the crown from Gates more permanently in the coming days and weeks . . . Whatâs most astounding about Bezosâ rise is his recent wealth surge. He has been a billionaire for nearly 20 years, first making the <em>Forbes</em> list in 1998 with a net worth of $1.6 billion after Amazonâs IPO. He chugged along for the following decade, reaching $4.4 billion in 2007, gradually rising to $18.4 billion by 2012, ranking him 26th on the list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But over the past two years, as Amazonâs stock has soared, so has Bezosâ fortune. His net worth has grown by $70 billion over the past five years, surging by $45 billion in the last two years alone &#8212; possibly the largest wealth-creation surge in history . . . Bezos may not only be the richest man in the world today &#8212; he might become the richest man ever, at least measured in pure dollars. At his peak Gates was worth $90 billion, marking the largest single fortune ever. With little sign that Amazonâs momentum may be slowing, Bezos could well be the first 12-digit man, worth $100 billion one day.</p>\n</blockquote>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","tags":["jeff bezos","amazon","bill gates"],"ledeCaption":"Could buy approximately 838,0828,045,211,430,198,381 Kindles and not make a dent in this net worth.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The Amazon founder has officially taken the crown&#8212;and put a target on his back.","seoTitle":"Jeff Bezos Just Became the Worldâs Richest Man at the Worst Possible Time","seoDescription":"The Amazon founder has officially taken the crownâand put a target on his back.","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos Just Became the Worldâs Richest Man at the Worst Possible Time","socialDescription":"The Amazon founder has officially taken the crownâand put a target on his back.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Zillionaires","promoHed":"Jeff Bezos Just Became the Worldâs Richest Man at the Worst Possible Time","promoDek":"The Amazon founder has officially taken the crown&#8212;and put a target on his back.","id":"597a39487c67a060584ba9c7","revision":4,"createdAt":"July 27, 2017 3:04 pm","modifiedAt":"July 27, 2017 3:28 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 27, 2017 3:28 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Bess Levin","filename":"Jeff-Bezos-Richest-Man.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/07/27/597a392e7c67a060584ba9c5_Jeff-Bezos-Richest-Man.jpg"}},"title":"jeff-bezos-richest","credit":"By David McNew/Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"597a392f7c67a060584ba9c6","revision":1,"createdAt":"July 27, 2017 3:04 pm","modifiedAt":"July 27, 2017 3:04 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 27, 2017 3:04 pm","tags":[],"altText":"jeff-bezos-richest","description":"Getty; 151364869","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Bess Levin","bio":"","socialMedia":[],"meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"email":"","channel":"","subChannel":"","id":"582375aeaf70ea5e7082bcd1","revision":6,"createdAt":"November 9, 2016 2:14 pm","modifiedAt":"December 21, 2016 7:51 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 21, 2016 7:51 pm","modelName":"contributor"}}],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"videosLede":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"597a39487c67a060584ba9c7","revision":4,"pubDate":"July 27, 2017 3:08 pm","revisionAuthor":"Bess Levin","searchable":true,"template":"default","expired":false,"createdAt":"July 27, 2017 3:28 pm","uri":"news/2017/07/jeff-bezos-worlds-richest"}},"modelName":"article","categories":{},"contributors":{"author":[{"id":"582375aeaf70ea5e7082bcd1","modelName":"contributor","bio":"","email":"","name":"Bess Levin","socialMedia":[]}]},"inlineEmbeds":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"revisionAuthor":"Bess Levin","filename":"Jeff-Bezos-Richest-Man.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/07/27/597a392e7c67a060584ba9c5_Jeff-Bezos-Richest-Man.jpg"}},"title":"jeff-bezos-richest","credit":"By David McNew/Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"597a392f7c67a060584ba9c6","revision":1,"createdAt":"July 27, 2017 3:04 pm","modifiedAt":"July 27, 2017 3:04 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 27, 2017 3:04 pm","tags":[],"altText":"jeff-bezos-richest","description":"Getty; 151364869","modelName":"photo"}]},"pubDate":"July 27, 2017 3:08 pm","related":[],"template":"default","url":"/news/2017/07/jeff-bezos-worlds-richest","videos":{}},{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","hed":"Jeff Bezos and Cory Booker May Be Headed for a $13.7 Billion Showdown","body":"<p>Not everyone is thrilled with Amazonâs <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition\">$13.7 billion</a> deal to buy up Whole Foods, the latest in a series of aggressive moves by the expansive e-commerce giant that have sent the stock prices of its brick-and-mortar competitors plummeting.

We deliver low-cost, healthy food to zip codes across the country that before Amazon had limited access to a large selection of high quality foods. We have every intention when the acquisition is complete to assist Whole Foods in bringing natural and healthy foods to more people,â <strong>Brian Huseman</strong>, Amazon&#39;s vice president of public policy, wrote in a letter to the Congressional Black Caucus. âWe are excited by our new initiatives in this area, including our participation in the US Department of Agriculture SNAP pilot program. [...] We also do not plan job reductions as part of the acquisition, which if approved would result in a company with a combined less than 3% of national grocery sales.â</p>\n<p>Amazonâs rapid expansion has been mostly praised by consumers, who can often find lower prices through the online retailer, but it has also raised questions about whether its behavior is anti-competitive and increasing inequality in historically underserved markets. âWeâre having a hard enough time getting supermarkets to move into urban communities, to give people choice, to give people price competitiveness, so that actually theyâre paying for affordable groceries,â Booker said. âI worry about grocery consolidation, I worry about the jobs that many of these grocery stores create, and so I am skeptical of this particular merger, highly skeptical of it, and I believe this consolidation as well as other consolidations, we should be holding a far higher bar than we are when we approve these.â</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["jeff bezos","amazon","whole foods","cory booker","anti-trust"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The potential 2020 contender wants more scrutiny of Amazonâs massive deal to buy Whole Foods.","seoTitle":"Jeff Bezos and Cory Booker May Be Headed for a $13.7 Billion Showdown","seoDescription":"The potential 2020 contender wants more scrutiny of Amazonâs massive deal to buy Whole Foods.","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos and Cory Booker May Be Headed for a $13.7 Billion Showdown","socialDescription":"The potential 2020 contender wants more scrutiny of Amazonâs massive deal to buy Whole Foods.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Amazon","promoHed":"Jeff Bezos and Cory Booker May Be Headed for a $13.7 Billion Showdown","promoDek":"The potential 2020 contender wants more scrutiny of Amazonâs massive deal to buy Whole Foods.","id":"597228bce3e3375c6a06ec09","revision":4,"createdAt":"July 21, 2017 12:15 pm","modifiedAt":"July 21, 2017 3:45 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 21, 2017 3:45 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"Bezos-Booker.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/07/21/597228defe060e64db80eadc_Bezos-Booker.jpg"}},"title":"Bezos-Booker.jpg","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"597228defe060e64db80eadd","revision":1,"createdAt":"July 21, 2017 12:16 pm","modifiedAt":"July 21, 2017 12:17 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 21, 2017 12:17 pm","credit":"Left; by Mark Wilson/Getty Images, Right; by Tibrina Hobson/Getty Images.","tags":[],"altText":"","description":"Getty; 649083070, 672164674","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

You be the chef.â Shares of Blue Apron immediately plummeted about 10 percent, bringing the companyâs valuation to an all-time low of $1.24 billion&#8212;nearly 33 percent below its market capitalization on the day of its I.P.O.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/886981471260508160\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/886981471260508160\">https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/886981471260508160</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/Contrahour/status/886969841265016833\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Contrahour/status/886969841265016833\">https://twitter.com/Contrahour/status/886969841265016833</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/StockTwits/status/886965736379490306\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/StockTwits/status/886965736379490306\">https://twitter.com/StockTwits/status/886965736379490306</a></p></blockquote></div><p>According to Amazonâs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sallyshin/status/886957073182806016\">application</a>, C.E.O. <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> is looking to create a product consisting of âprepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or and [sic] vegetables . . . ready for cooking and assembly as a mealâ&#8212;virtually the same service offered by Blue Apron, but presumably powered by Amazonâs hyper-competitive, highly advanced logistics network. That network would only grow more powerful with the acquisition of Whole Foods, which would give Amazon access to both upscale food offerings and produce delivery hubs in key markets across the country. If Amazon wants to go after Blue Apron, much like Facebook apparently has its sights set on replicating and eliminating Snapchat, it would be well-positioned to do so. Whole Foods customers could be using Amazon Prime to have their groceries delivered directly to their door&#8212;while getting access to Amazonâs streaming, music, and other digital properties to boot. With its latest trademark application, Blue Apronâs untimely demise is looking more and more like a fait accompli.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["blue apron","amazon","whole foods","meal kit","jeff bezos"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Amazon just filed a trademark that could decimate one of its rivals.","seoTitle":"Jeff Bezos Is Officially Coming for Blue Apronâand Investors Are Fleeing","seoDescription":"Amazon just filed a trademark that could decimate one of its rivals.","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos Is Officially Coming for Blue Apronâand Investors Are Fleeing","socialDescription":"Amazon just filed a trademark that could decimate one of its rivals.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Blue Apron","promoHed":"Jeff Bezos Is Officially Coming for Blue Apron&#8212;and Investors Are Fleeing","promoDek":"Amazon just filed a trademark that could decimate one of its rivals.","id":"596cee76bbf8842bfabbf7cf","revision":4,"createdAt":"July 17, 2017 1:05 pm","modifiedAt":"July 17, 2017 1:23 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 17, 2017 1:23 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Benjamin Landy","filename":"Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-Mealkits.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1381,"height":921,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":107,"height":921,"width":1381}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":1539,"height":923,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":105,"height":923,"width":1539}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":685,"height":1028,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":127,"y":0,"height":1028,"width":685}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":575,"height":1023,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":155,"y":5,"height":1023,"width":575}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1539,"height":659,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":3,"y":262,"height":659,"width":1539}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1535,"height":863,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":165,"height":863,"width":1535}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1269,"height":952,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":76,"height":952,"width":1269}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1028,"height":1028,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":1028,"width":1028}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/07/17/596cef3a9ebb7a2c01f884a9_Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-Mealkits.jpg","width":1543,"height":1029,"duration":null}},"title":"96651407","credit":"By Drew Angerer/Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"596cef3a9ebb7a2c01f884aa","revision":2,"createdAt":"July 17, 2017 1:09 pm","modifiedAt":"July 17, 2017 1:21 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 17, 2017 1:21 pm","tags":[],"altText":"96651407","description":"Getty; 813883140","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

Last month, the e-commerce giant <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/the-amazon-whole-foods-merger-is-already-wreaking-havoc\">wreaked havoc</a> on rival grocery stores when it announced a $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, immediately confronting dozens of companies with the prospect of having to compete with food-delivery service Amazon Fresh. In one day, investors pulled billions of dollars from competing businesses, with the market cap destruction totaling <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/amazons-whole-foods-bid-wipes-billions-off-retailers-food-stocks.html\">almost $40 billion</a> for the 20 worst-performing food and retail stocks on the S&amp;P alone. Days later, meal-kit delivery service Blue Apron was forced to <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/blue-apron-shares-fall\">slash its target I.P.O. value</a> by nearly one billion dollars; the stock has since slumped by about 20 percent.</p>\n<p>Now, Amazon is moving onto Best Buyâs turf. <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/7/10/15930998/amazon-geek-squad-smart-home-alexa-set-up-installation-consultation\">Recode reports</a> that the $483 billion company is assembling its own Geek Squad to rival Best Buyâs famed tech assistance team, amassing an army of gadget experts and handymen to help install smart-home products inside customersâ homes in seven west coast markets, including Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and a number of California cities.</p>\n<p>Much like the Geek Squad, Amazonâs new service offers workers who come to your home at a designated appointment time, booked through Amazonâs website or, one imagines, through the companyâs smart-home device, the Echo. The company has also started offering â<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Home-Consultation/dp/B01N3JQ196\">Alexa Smart Home Consultations</a>,â a 45-minute demo with an Amazon expert who tests the strength of customerâs Wi-Fi network and letâs them try out various smart-home products before making a customized list of recommendations for Amazon products. Itâs a push to close the gap for people who may not fully understand how smart devices work, or why theyâd use them in their homes, while promoting the capabilities of the Echo voice assistant.</p>\n<p>Shares of Best Buy <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/10/best-buy-shares-dive-on-news-of-amazon-geek-squad-competitor.html\">plunged in value</a> immediately after the news broke Monday, shaving <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/7/10/15947690/best-buy-stock-drop-amazon-geek-squad-competitor\">about $1 billion</a> off the retail electronics companyâs market cap. That drop may reflect investor worries that Amazon could potentially compete with Best Buyâs in-home handyman service, which has been a <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/best-buy-stakes-big-share-of-its-future-on-geek-squad/164067446/\">cash cow</a> for the company. But it also underscores worries that Best Buy will face competition in one of the few areas where it maintained a unique edge. While other brick-and-mortar retailers have felt the pinch from online competition, Best Buyâs stock has soared in recent years, in part thanks to Geek Squadâs ability to bridge the gap between retail stores, e-commerce, and in-home consumer education. Where other retailers floundered, Best Buy <a href=\"http://time.com/4411333/best-buy-amazon-geek-squad-hubert-joly/\">doubled down</a> on staff training, turned stores into demonstration spaces, and leveraged its physical locations into distribution hubs for fulfilling online sales. The Geek Squad has been a central part of that vision.</p>\n<p>Now, Amazon is making a concerted effort to own that entire customer experience, including the in-person assistance that has been a major asset for Best Buy. Itâs worth noting that Amazon already has a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Home-Services/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10192820011\">third-party marketplace</a> on its website offering home services like device installation, but this new initiative seems like a push to get users to start thinking about the Echo as central to an Amazon ecosystem that now includes brick-and-mortar <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?node=13270229011\">bookstores</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011\">grocery stores</a>. Plus, educating customers about its smart-home services wonât happen overnight&#8212;at least not without some hand-holding. It canât all happen virtually.</p>\n<p>Though Amazon has long been considered an online retailer and logistics business, itâs made clear in recent years that its ambitions include expanding into just about any related sector or industry. The worldâs fourth-most valuable public company has moved far beyond retail and into digital media, including a TV and movie production company; a logistics business complete with its own aircraft, trucks, and drones; an in-house line of home goods; and cloud computing and Web services. Now, Amazon wants to add being on your doorstep and in your home to that long, and growing list.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["jeff bezos","amazon","valuation"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Amazonâs relentless expansion claims another victim.","seoTitle":"Jeff Bezos Just Wiped Another Billion Dollars Off a Rivalâs Valuation","seoDescription":"Amazonâs relentless expansion claims another victim.","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos Just Wiped Another Billion Dollars Off a Rivalâs Valuation","socialDescription":"Amazonâs relentless expansion claims another victim.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Amazon","promoHed":"Jeff Bezos Just Wiped Another Billion Dollars Off a Rivalâs Valuation","promoDek":"Amazonâs relentless expansion claims another victim.","id":"5963d2ee3a5a726a87a62ff8","revision":6,"createdAt":"July 10, 2017 3:18 pm","modifiedAt":"July 10, 2017 4:42 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 10, 2017 4:42 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jordan Amchin","filename":"Jeff-Bezos.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/07/10/5963e67a96475a07efe99348_Jeff-Bezos.jpg"}},"title":"87197105","credit":"By Amanda Edwards/WireImage.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5963e67a96475a07efe99349","revision":2,"createdAt":"July 10, 2017 4:41 pm","modifiedAt":"July 10, 2017 4:42 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"July 10, 2017 4:42 pm","tags":[],"altText":"87197105","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

For one, Bezos visited the White House just last week to talk to Trump about, among other things, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/the-real-reason-tech-billionaires-should-fear-trump\">giving tech companies big tax breaks</a>. Now, because Trump appears to be mad at <em>The Washington Post</em>&#8212;whether because of the <em>Time</em> story or some other article&#8212;he is threatening to impose or enforce some kind of major new tax on Amazon, which has little relationship with the <em>Post</em> beyond their shared connection with Bezos. While it is hard to decipher, it would seem that Trump could be endorsing a bill to let states levy additional taxes on sales on e-commerce. He may be unaware that Amazon customers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15055662/amazon-us-sales-tax-collection-all-states\">currently pay sales taxes</a> in all applicable U.S. states, though there is no federal âInternet tax.â</p>\n<p>Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that the president of the United States is openly calling for the owner of a news organization that is critical of his administration to be punished, via government policy, apparently for publishing stories that he dislikes. And while Trump may very well be a paper tiger, it is not necessarily an idle threat.

The argument goes like this: in order to colonize the Moon, humans will first need to ship sufficient cargo there to begin building structures capable of sustaining life. (Musk has <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/10/11903988/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony-plan-details\">outlined</a> a similar proposal to set the stage for a colony on Mars, if and when SpaceX sends rockets to the Red Planet.) To that end, Bezos says he wants to work with NASA to create the interplanetary version of Amazon Prime, using a brand-new Blue Moon rocket to deliver 10,000 pounds of cargo per trip to a particular crater at the South Pole, where there is both ice water and sunlight. Eventually, the stage would be set for a permanent âfuture human settlement.â</p>\n<p>âItâs time for America to go back to the Moon and this time to stay. We can do it. Itâs a difficult but worthy objective,â Bezos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjz2vP3zPhE\">said</a> at an event last week. The mission, he explained would be contingent on NASAâs assistance to create âincentives to the private sector to demonstrate a commercial lunar cargo delivery serviceâ by 2020.</p>\n<p>Excitement surrounding the prospect of renewed human spaceflight has grown in recent years as the private aerospace industry has begun to mature. While the Obama administration was interested in distant space exploration and putting humans on Mars by 2030, Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/donald-trump-space-war-234829\">wants the U.S. to return to the moon</a>, placing priority on low-Earth orbit activity. Private contractors like SpaceX have talked more about their goals to ramp up space tourism, which could become a significant source of revenue. Other companies, like Bigelow Aerospace, have discussed the possibility of putting space stations in lunar orbit, <a href=\"https://www.geektime.com/2017/03/01/forget-spacex-10-companies-that-will-change-space-travel-in-2017-2018/\">near the moon</a>. If Bezos wants to start making Earth-to-moon deliveries on his rockets, heâll likely have the support of the Trump administration to do so.</p>","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos Wants to Ship Packages to the Moon","socialDescription":"Think of it as an interplanetary version of Amazon Prime.","seoTitle":"Jeff Bezos Wants to Ship Packages to the Moon","seoDescription":"Think of it as an interplanetary version of Amazon Prime.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["jeff bezos","amazon","moon","space","blue origin","rockets","cargo"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"issueDate":"","id":"58b9df07c486164de2e4566c","revision":1,"createdAt":"March 3, 2017 4:24 pm","modifiedAt":"March 3, 2017 4:25 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"March 3, 2017 4:25 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Benjamin Park","filename":"jeff-bezos-starry-night.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1440,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":1440,"height":960}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":1440,"height":864,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":1440,"height":864}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":639,"height":959,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":166,"y":0,"height":959,"width":639}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":540,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":259,"y":0,"height":960,"width":540}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1434,"height":614,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":93,"height":614,"width":1434}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1440,"height":810,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":52,"height":810,"width":1440}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1279,"height":959,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":123,"y":0,"height":959,"width":1279}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":779,"height":779,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"y":68,"height":779,"width":779}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/03/03/58b9dd0da50ee02e65e430e7_jeff-bezos-starry-night.jpg","width":1440,"height":960,"duration":null}},"title":"SPACE SYMPOSIUM","credit":"From Bloomberg/Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"58b9dd0da50ee02e65e430e8","revision":2,"createdAt":"March 3, 2017 4:15 pm","modifiedAt":"March 3, 2017 4:29 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"March 3, 2017 4:29 pm","tags":[],"altText":"SPACE SYMPOSIUM","description":"Not250: 520716340","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

In December, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> sent a string of tweets criticizing the Amazon C.E.O., who in 2013 bought the <em>Washington Post,</em> for allegedly using the newspaper as a âtax shelter.â In response, Bezos <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/674008204838199297\">fired back</a> that Trump should be sent into space on one of Bezosâs Blue Origin spaceships. âFinally trashed by @realDonaldTrump,â Bezos tweeted. âWill still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket.â Bezos included the hashtag â#sendDonaldtospace,â along with a video of one of the rockets developed by his private aerospace company.</p>\n<p>But Bezos also spoke seriously about the threat that the Republican nominee poses to American political institutions. âI donât know how dangerous he is, because the United States is remarkably robust, but it is inappropriate for a presidential candidate,â Bezos said of Trumpâs rhetoric. âWhen you look at the pattern of things, heâs not just going after the media and threatening retribution for those who scrutinize him. Itâs also him saying he may not give a graceful concession speech if he loses the election. That erodes our democracy around the edges. These arenât acceptable behaviors, in my opinion.â</p>\n<p>In regard to sending Trump to space, Bezos quipped: âI have a rocket company, so the capability is there.â</p>\n<p>Bezos also took the opportunity to talk about the <em>Post.</em> âIâm not there very often,â Bezos told Isaacson. âI have a day job&#8212;I tap dance into Amazon. I live on the other side of the country, literally. Thereâs a long tradition at the <em>Post</em> of just putting a lot of shoe leather into things. The <em>Post</em> is very lucky; itâs physically located in the capital city of the most important country in the world.â</p>\n<p>Consumer privacy, too, was on Bezosâs mind. âOne of the great issues of our age is going to be privacy,â he explained. âI would posit to you that any nation-state in the world could put a virus on your phone and spy on you.â But Bezos didnât hesitate to share a few personal details with the Summit audience, nonetheless. Before he was a tech titan worth <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/\">$70 billion</a>, Bezos said he spent his childhood summers on a ranch with his grandfather watching the soap opera <em>Days of Our Lives.</em> Billionaires: theyâre just like us.</p>","tags":["vf summit","new-establishment","jeff bezos","amazon","blue origin","washington post"],"contentSource":"web","rubric":"V.F.

Bezosâs New Shepard booster rocket, which <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-blueorigin-idUSKCN1251XE\">took off</a> Wednesday, was designed to test its new escape capsule, which would carry passengers to safety in the event of a major failure during flight.

Itâs unclear how much it will cost passengers, but comparable rides on <strong>Richard Bransonâs</strong> Virgin Galacticâs space trip <a href=\"http://www.virgingalactic.com/human-spaceflight/fly-with-us/\">will cost about $250,000</a>. âWeâll probably fly test pilots in 2017, and if weâre successful then Iâd imagine putting paying astronauts on in 2018,â <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/jeff-bezoss-blue-origin-passengers-2018\">Bezos told reporters</a> during the first media tour of the Blue Origin manufacturing plant in Washington state earlier this year.

But that was before he went and sold 1 million Amazon shares last week for $757 million, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872416000292/xslF345X03/wf-form4_147035040433988.xml\">a regulatory filing</a>, a record amount for the founder and C.E.O.</p>\n<p>Being a multi-billionaire on paper is nice, but cash on hand is nicer. As it happens, in the last three months alone, Bezos has cashed in on $1.4 billion worth of Amazon shares, including the 1 million shares he offloaded for $671 million in May. Both sales occurred just after Amazon reported strong quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations and boosted the e-commerce giantâs stock price, which has leapt 45 percent in the last year. Itâs not as though Bezos is in a panic to get rid of the shares while theyâre hot or do anything untoward; according to the regulatory filing, Bezos was on a set schedule to get rid of 1 million shares just after each quarter. If the results hadnât been so good and the stock price wasnât so high, he still would have had to make the sale.</p>\n<p>But the reality is that online sales have been strong and its cloud software business is soaring. As a result, Amazon recently overtook Exxon Mobil to become the fourth-most-valuable U.S. company based on market cap. Bezos himself leapfrogged over <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> to become the <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/jeff-bezos-worlds-third-richest-man\">third-richest man</a> in the world, behind only <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and <strong>Amancio Ortega.</strong></p>\n<p>A company on a tear and $1.4 billion in the bank is great. For Bezos, something tells us that donning a craggy alien costume on the <em>Star Trek</em> set was better.</p>\n<div class=\"embed slideshow article-slideshow-embed row\" id=\"embed-gallery-577ffe153acd1f4426d7aa20\" data-type=\"slideshow\"><div class=\"slideshow-container embed\"><div><div class=\"embed-title\"><a href=\"/news/photos/2016/07/most-stylish-shades-sun-valley-conference\" class=\"embed-enlarge\">Full Screen</a><strong class=\"label\">Photos:</strong><div class=\"component-counter\" data-component=\"Counter\"><div class=\"counter\"><span class=\"current\">1</span><span class=\"divider\">/</span><span class=\"total\">12</span></div></div><span class=\"embed-dek\">The Most Stylish Shades From the Sun Valley Conference</span></div><div class=\"embed-slideshow-container first-slide\"><div class=\"slick-initialized slick-slider\"><div class=\"slick-list\"><div class=\"slick-track\"><div class=\"slick-slide slick-active slick-cloned\" data-index=\"0\" style=\"outline:none;position:relative;left:0;opacity:1;transition:opacity 0ms ease;-webkit-transition:opacity 0ms ease;\" tabindex=\"-1\" title=\"\"><div class=\"slideshow-slide\"><div class=\"slideshow-slide-photo\"><div class=\"slideshow-slide-photo-image\"><div class=\"component-photo\"><div class=\"component-rendition\" data-aspect-ratio=\"master\" data-component=\"Rendition\"><div class=\"component-image pending\" style=\"height:590px;\" data-component=\"Image\"><img alt=\"Shari Redstone, the First Lady of the Redstone empire, sports a modern Jackie Onasis look.\" src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/577ffe6a3acd1f4426d7aa21/master/h_590,c_limit/sun-valley-conference-sunglasses-2016-01.jpg\"/></div></div></div></div><div class=\"embed-info-text\"><h2 class=\"title\"></h2><div class=\"caption\">Shari Redstone, the First Lady of the Redstone empire, sports a modern Jackie Onasis look.</div><cite>Photo: By Drew Angerer/Getty Images.</cite></div></div></div></div><div class=\"slick-slide slick-cloned\" data-index=\"1\" style=\"outline:none;position:relative;left:0;opacity:0;transition:opacity 0ms ease;-webkit-transition:opacity 0ms ease;\" tabindex=\"-1\" title=\"\"><div class=\"slideshow-slide\"><div class=\"slideshow-slide-photo\"><div class=\"slideshow-slide-photo-image\"><div class=\"component-photo\"><div class=\"component-rendition\" data-aspect-ratio=\"master\" data-component=\"Rendition\"><div class=\"component-image pending\" style=\"height:590px;\" data-component=\"Image\"><img alt=\"Coca-Cola C.E.O.

","familyName":"Buffett","bio":"Known as the âOracle of Omaha,â the worldâs most successful investor Warren Buffett was a born businessman. He sold bottles of Coke and chewing gum door-to-door as a child, and on his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett made sure he deducted $35 for his bicycle and watch, which he used on his paper-delivery route. His senior yearbook picture read: âlikes math; a future stockbroker.â Buffett spent a lot of time as a child in the lounge at a stock brokerage near his dadâs own stock brokerage office. When he graduated from college, Buffett had saved more than the equivalent of $90,000.\n<p>Buffett began investing with economist Benjamin Graham at Graham&#39;s partnership. The two worked closely until Graham retired and closed his partnership in 1956, at which point Buffett had accumulated more than $1 million in savings by todayâs measures, and he started his own group: Buffett Partnership Ltd. His partnerships would make him a millionaire in the 1960s. Buffett eventually took over textile manufacturing firm Berkshire Hathaway and moved it from the textiles business into the insurance sector. Buffett has invested in a number of companies, though his most lucrative may be Coca-Cola, of which he owns about 400 million shares, according to Bloomberg. He became a billionaire in 1990 and is now worth approximately $67 billion. He takes a relatively small salary of $100,000.</p>\n<p>Buffett was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012, and underwent radiation treatment three months later. In September of that year, he announced heâd completed treatment. âI am so glad to say thatâs over,â he said. A Democrat, Buffett has donated to Barack Obamaâs presidential campaigns, and endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 election. Buffett has pledged to give away 99 percent of his wealth to charitable causes.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/26/574772770f807a3a48c6e6c4_hive-contributor-profile-warren-buffett.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-warren-buffett.jpg","_embedded":{"photosTout":[],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-warren-buffett.jpg","credit":"By Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57477277b1a9903a488276e4","createdAt":"May 26, 2016 6:02 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:03 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 501633612","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/warren-buffett","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/26/574772770f807a3a48c6e6c4_hive-contributor-profile-warren-buffett.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-warren-buffett.jpg","_embedded":{"photosTout":[],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-warren-buffett.jpg","credit":"By Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57477277b1a9903a488276e4","createdAt":"May 26, 2016 6:02 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:03 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 501633612","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"57433149b09823be03ef3d05","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/warren-buffett"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"revisionAuthor":"Benjamin Landy","hed":"Not Even Warren Buffett Can Find Something Sexy to Say About President Trump","promoHed":"Not Even Warren Buffett Can Find Something Sexy to Say About Trump","dek":"Perhaps $29 billion worth of tax cuts will get his creative juices flowing.","promoDek":"Perhaps $29 billion worth of tax cuts will get his creative juices flowing.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","seoTitle":"Not Even Warren Buffett Can Find Something Sexy to Say About President Trump","seoDescription":"Perhaps $29 billion worth of tax cuts will get his creative juices flowing.","socialTitle":"Not Even Warren Buffett Can Find Something Sexy to Say About President Trump","socialDescription":"Perhaps $29 billion worth of tax cuts will get his creative juices flowing.","body":"<p><strong>Warren Buffett</strong> is one of the richest men in the world, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/people/warren-buffett\">made famous by shrewd investing</a> and folksy business wisdom. Often, that folksy business wisdom contains metaphors involving <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-26/money-and-sex-warren-buffett-the-winking-sage-of-omaha\">various sexual scenarios</a>, whether heâs commenting on stocks being undervalued (â<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2008/09/warren_buffetts_dirty_words_of.html\">I feel like an oversexed guy in a whorehouse</a>â) or <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122226055484170915\">recalling</a> getting a call in March 2007 about buying Bear Stearns (âItâs like a woman taking off half her clothes and asking, âShould I continue?â Even if youâre a 90-year-old eunuch, you let âem finishâ). But like fellow investing luminary <strong>Bill Gross</strong>, who was <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/bill-gross-trump-toilets\">too depressed</a> in the wake of the presidential election to pen his usual letter to investors (beginning, as usual, with a personal story such as why sneezing feels so good or how automatic toilets are the work of Satan), the ascension of <strong>Donald J. Trump</strong> has left Buffett somewhat out of sorts. Buffett, a vocal supporter of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> who threw the Democratic nominee 15 fund-raisers, has now given two post-election interviews, and not one has contained a reference to how randy heâs feeling. Instead, Buffett simply <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/12/05/warren-buffett-donald-trump-election/\">told <em>Fortune</em></a> that we can take solace in knowing that, at the very least, Trump will probably be good news for equities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âThe aggregate output of this country per capita is going to keep going up. Now who gets it depends on what government decides in terms of tax laws and all that. But America will be a wealthier country per capita five years from now, ten years from now, and twenty years from now. You name it...Long-term, the stock market is going to be higher, and Iâve written that many times.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question of who benefits from economic growth is one that has long concerned Buffett. Back in 2011, the Sage of Omaha was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-14962769\">publicly lamenting</a> loopholes that allowed him to pay less in taxes than his secretary. (President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> famously named his proposed solution the âBuffett Rule.â) But while Buffett is apparently so personally distraught that he canât even manage to craft a risquÃ© metaphor for his situation&#8212;like bedding a buxom milkmaid that left him feeling hollow the next day&#8212;there may be a silver lining to the Trump presidency for Berkshire Hathaway. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-05/berkshire-boost-from-trump-tax-plan-seen-as-high-as-29-billion\">Per Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warren Buffettâs Berkshire Hathaway Inc. could get a $29 billion boost to its book value under tax-rate cuts advocated by President-elect Donald Trump, according to Barclays Plc. âWe would view this magnitude of increase as favorable for Berkshire shares since it is generally valued on price to book value,â Barclays analysts led by Jay Gelb said in a note to investors Monday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Itâs not the same as Hillary winning, but itâs something. Hopefully heâll be back to his old frisky self in no time.</p>","tags":["Warren Buffett","Donald Trump","Berkshire Hathaway","election","economy"],"contentSource":"web","rubric":"Trump White House","ledeCaption":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"issueDate":"","id":"58470bb80f5275fb64422083","revision":16,"createdAt":"December 6, 2016 2:04 pm","modifiedAt":"December 7, 2016 2:14 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 7, 2016 2:14 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Bess Levin","filename":"Warren-Buffett-sad-election-results-trump.jpg","title":"Warren-Buffett-sad-election-results-trump.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/12/06/584705689dee4a361369e3f3_Warren-Buffett-sad-election-results-trump.jpg"}},"credit":"By Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"584705689dee4a361369e3f4","revision":1,"createdAt":"December 6, 2016 1:37 pm","modifiedAt":"December 6, 2016 1:37 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 6, 2016 1:37 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 526927850","modelName":"photo","altText":""}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Bess Levin","bio":"","socialMedia":[],"meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"email":"","channel":"","subChannel":"","id":"582375aeaf70ea5e7082bcd1","revision":6,"createdAt":"November 9, 2016 2:14 pm","modifiedAt":"December 21, 2016 7:51 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 21, 2016 7:51 pm","modelName":"contributor"}}],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"videosLede":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"58470bb80f5275fb64422083","revision":16,"pubDate":"December 6, 2016 2:28 pm","revisionAuthor":"Benjamin Landy","searchable":true,"template":"default","expired":false,"createdAt":"December 7, 2016 2:14 pm","uri":"news/2016/12/not-even-warren-buffett-can-find-something-sexy-to-say-about-president-trump"}},"modelName":"article","categories":{},"contributors":{"author":[{"id":"582375aeaf70ea5e7082bcd1","modelName":"contributor","bio":"","email":"","name":"Bess Levin","socialMedia":[]}]},"inlineEmbeds":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"revisionAuthor":"Bess Levin","filename":"Warren-Buffett-sad-election-results-trump.jpg","title":"Warren-Buffett-sad-election-results-trump.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/12/06/584705689dee4a361369e3f3_Warren-Buffett-sad-election-results-trump.jpg"}},"credit":"By Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"584705689dee4a361369e3f4","revision":1,"createdAt":"December 6, 2016 1:37 pm","modifiedAt":"December 6, 2016 1:37 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 6, 2016 1:37 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 526927850","modelName":"photo","altText":""}]},"pubDate":"December 6, 2016 2:28 pm","related":[],"template":"default","url":"/news/2016/12/not-even-warren-buffett-can-find-something-sexy-to-say-about-president-trump","videos":{}},{"revisionAuthor":"Copilot API Migration Script","hed":"Warren Buffett Hits Back at Trump After Debate, Releases Personal Tax Details","promoHed":"Warren Buffett Calls Trumpâs Bluff, Releases Personal Tax Details","dek":"The Oracle of Omaha challenged the G.O.P. nominee to release his tax returns, again.","promoDek":"The Oracle of Omaha challenged the G.O.P. nominee to release his tax returns, again.","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","seoTitle":"Warren Buffett Hits Back at Trump After Debate, Releases Personal Tax Details","seoDescription":"The Oracle of Omaha challenged the G.O.P. nominee to release his tax returns, again.","socialTitle":"Warren Buffett Hits Back at Trump After Debate, Releases Personal Tax Details","socialDescription":"The Oracle of Omaha challenged the G.O.P. nominee to release his tax returns, again.","body":"<p><strong>Warren Buffettâs</strong> ears must have been ringing on Sunday night. During the second presidential debate <strong>Donald Trump</strong> confirmed that <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/donald-trump-federal-income-taxes\">he used a reported nearly $1 billion</a> loss in the mid-1990s to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years to come, and then called out the Oracle of Omaha for allegedly doing the same. In response, Buffett pulled back the curtain on his tax returns and challenged his fellow billionaire to do release his own.</p>\n<p>Trump has staunchly refused to release his tax returns throughout this election, breaking with a decades-long tradition of presidential candidates doing so. Two weeks ago, however, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">published</a> three pages of tax documents that offered a small window into the G.O.P. nomineeâs finances. The tax filings, which were sent anonymously to the <em>Times</em> in the mail, revealed that in 1995, Trump reported a $916 million loss, which tax experts say may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for the next 18 years. On the debate stage this weekend, Trump confirmed that this was, in fact, true.</p>\n<p>When CNNâs <strong>Anderson Cooper</strong> asked the bombastic New York billionaire if he used the massive loss to skirt income taxes, the presidential hopeful <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate-transcript-229519\">responded</a>, âOf course I did. Of course I did.â But then quickly tried to divert the attention to other wealthy individuals&#8212;specifically wealthy <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> donors&#8212;asserting that both Buffett and <strong>George Soros</strong> also took advantage of the tax maneuver. âWarren Buffett took a massive deduction,â Trump argued.</p>\n<p>Buffett, who has several times throughout the election called on Trump to release his tax returns, was quick to clap back at the Republican standard bearer <a href=\"https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r.3LJgYnezD4/v0\">in a statement</a> issued on Monday. âMr. Trump says he knows more about taxes than any other human,â Buffett wrote. âHe has not seen my income tax returns. But I am happy to give him the facts.â The billionaire then detailed that in 2015, his adjusted gross income was $11.6 million, his deductions totaled $5.5 million, and he paid a total of $1.8 million in federal income tax for the year.</p>\n<p>âI have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13,â Buffett wrote, joking that he was âa slow starter,â before dismissing Trumpâs claim that he has benefited from carried interest. âI have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward.â</p>\n<p>The billionaire then concluded his statement, which is titled âSome Tax Facts for Donald Trump,â by attacking the G.O.P. nomineeâs enduring argument that he cannot release his tax returns because he is currently under audit by the I.R.S. âI have been audited by the I.R.S. multiple times and am currently being audited,â Buffett leveled. âI have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump&#8212;at least he would have no <em>legal</em> problem.â</p>\n<p><em>For more Hive coverage of the second presidential debate, read T.A.

Fargo","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","body":"<p>The real losers in the Wells Fargo scandal that broke last week, besides the thousands of fraudsters no longer employed by the bank, are the hundreds of thousands of customers who got scammed out of their hard-earned money. As the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed last week when it announced that it had <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/wells-fargo-fine\">reached a $185 million settlement agreement</a> with the bank, Wells Fargo employees allegedly spent years opening unauthorized bank accounts and credit cards for customers in order to obtain sales bonuses. Over five years, some 5,300 employees&#8212;now fired&#8212;were involved in opening 1.5 million deposit accounts and applying for 565,000 credit cards without customer approval, according to a statement from the federal agency.</p>\n<p>But Wells Fargo customers arenât the <em>only</em> ones who lost out, particularly since the bank has now agreed to pay them restitution. One stakeholder who isnât getting his money back is <strong>Warren Buffett,</strong> the worldâs <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/2016-09-13/aaa\">fourth-richest man</a>, who lost big the moment news of the scandal broke. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, is Wells Fargoâs biggest shareholder, which means he bled money when the stock tumbled 3.3 percent on Tuesday. Buffettâs personal fortune dropped $1.4 billion over the course of that one day, according to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/buffett-loses-1-4-billion-as-wells-fargo-tumbles-on-scandal\">Bloomberg</a>, as shares of Berkshire Hathaway also fell 2 percent. Since Friday, heâs lost a total of $1.6 billion, and as Wells Fargo fell another 1 percent in trading Wednesday, he is poised to lose even more.</p>\n<p>At least Buffett is not alone. With global stocks melting down, the worldâs billionaires have shed $93 billion since Friday, Bloomberg reported. __Amancio Ortega__has lost $3.3 billion over this period, <strong>Bill Gates</strong> had $2.4 billion wiped out, and <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> has said good-bye to $1.9 billion. So fear not, Warren Buffett. All your billionaire buddies are in a similar boat&#8212;or yacht, as it may be.</p>","tags":["warren buffett","wells fargo","billionaires","berkshire hathaway","net

Omaha.","body":"<p>Billionaire Midwesterner <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> has a refreshing take on the circus of a presidential election and the utter hysteria surrounding it. According to the Oracle of Omaha, everything is going to be O.K., even if <strong>Donald Trump</strong> winds up in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>âBusiness in this country has done extraordinarily well for a couple hundred years. It has adapted to society and society has adapted to business,â he said when a shareholder asked him at Berkshire Hathawayâs annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday about a President Trump.</p>\n<p>Responding to whether having the Donald at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would impact the financial performance of his company, Buffett, a fervent <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> supporter, responded that Trumpâs impact on Berkshire âwonât be the main problem.â The crowd <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-results-idUSKCN0XR0GT\">reportedly</a> broke out into laughter. âIf either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton becomes president, and one of them is very likely to be, I think Berkshire will continue to do fine.â</p>\n<p>Billionaires and board rooms have tensed up in recent months as rhetoric from both sides of the aisle has veered into populist territory&#8212;igniting discussions about stricter regulations and higher corporate tax rates. Concerns about Trump, in particular, and his vow to raise tariffs on key trading partners like China, have been gnawing away at the .01 percent. But Buffett, who answered questions for five hours at his 51st annual meeting, reassured his investors that Berkshire has operated under these kinds of conditions before and came out just fine. Plus, he noted, he doesnât think Trump or Clinton would go after Big Business in a big way.</p>\n<p>Buffett may have forfeited his chance to take a swipe at Trump, but he went right after Americaâs other favorite punching bag: hedge funds. He told the crowd that he would offer âprobably the most important investment lesson in the world.â He said that years of poor returns and high fees are fleecing a lot of âsupposedly sophisticated peopleâ into making these fruitless investments. âThereâs been far, far, far more money made by people in Wall Street through salesmanship abilities than through investment abilities.â</p>\n<p>That is a line Trump himself could use on the campaign trail, though perhaps he would be an imperfect messenger for a warning about getting conned.</p>","tags":["warren buffett","donald trump","hedge fund","_fb_instant"],"contentSource":"web","rubric":"TRUMPED","ledeCaption":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"identifiable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"572755dda8a311355b440578","revision":3,"createdAt":"May 2, 2016 9:27 am","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2016 1:06 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2016 1:06 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Emily Fox","caption":"","credit":"By Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","title":"warren-buffett-donald-trump.jpg","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"identifiable":false,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5727551ef77ea6eb0f055628","revision":3,"createdAt":"May 2, 2016 9:24 am","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2016 9:25 am","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2016 9:25 am","filename":"warren-buffett-donald-trump.jpg","restrictCropping":false,"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/02/5727551ef77ea6eb0f05562a_warren-buffett-donald-trump.jpg"}},"description":"Not 250:472078176","modelName":"photo","altText":""}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Emily Jane Fox","email":"emily_fox@condenast.com","bio":"Emily Jane Fox is a reporter for the Hive covering Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the .001 percent everywhere.","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"@emilyjanefox"}],"id":"55d210ba8fbf768838dcd23d","revision":10,"createdAt":"August 17, 2015 12:50 pm","modifiedAt":"December 6, 2016 2:24 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 6, 2016 2:24 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"identifiable":true,"hierarchical":false},"channel":"","subChannel":"","modelName":"contributor"}}],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"videosLede":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"572755dda8a311355b440578","revision":3,"uri":"news/2016/05/warren-buffett-donald-trump-berkshire-hathaway","pubDate":"May 2, 2016 9:28 am","revisionAuthor":"Molly McGlew","searchable":true,"template":"default","expired":false,"createdAt":"May 2, 2016 1:06 pm"}},"modelName":"article","categories":{},"contributors":{"author":[{"id":"55d210ba8fbf768838dcd23d","modelName":"contributor","bio":"Emily Jane Fox is a reporter for the Hive covering Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the .001 percent everywhere.","email":"emily_fox@condenast.com","name":"Emily Jane Fox","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"@emilyjanefox"}]}]},"inlineEmbeds":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"revisionAuthor":"Emily Fox","caption":"","credit":"By Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","title":"warren-buffett-donald-trump.jpg","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"identifiable":false,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5727551ef77ea6eb0f055628","revision":3,"createdAt":"May 2, 2016 9:24 am","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2016 9:25 am","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2016 9:25 am","filename":"warren-buffett-donald-trump.jpg","restrictCropping":false,"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/02/5727551ef77ea6eb0f05562a_warren-buffett-donald-trump.jpg"}},"description":"Not 250:472078176","modelName":"photo","altText":""}]},"pubDate":"May 2, 2016 9:28 am","related":[],"template":"default","url":"/news/2016/05/warren-buffett-donald-trump-berkshire-hathaway","videos":{}},{"revisionAuthor":"Kia Makarechi","hed":"Warren Buffett Coins The Eat âLike a Six-Year-Oldâ Diet","dek":"Coca-Cola and potato sticks or ice cream for breakfast?","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","seoTitle":"Warren Buffett Coins The Eat âLike a Six-Year-Oldâ Diet","seoDescription":"Coca-Cola and potato sticks or ice cream for breakfast?

The Oracle of Omaha said his daily food intake mirrors of that of a small child.</p>\n<p>âI checked the actuarial tables, and the lowest death rate is among six-year-olds,â Buffett told the magazine. âSo I decided to eat like a six-year-old.â</p>\n<p>Hereâs what that looks like: Coca-Cola and Utz Potato Stix for breakfast, with ice cream for breakfast on a special day. Cherry Coke at home, and regular Coke at the office. âIf I eat 2,700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola,â Buffett said. âI drink at least five 12-ounce servings. I do it every day.â</p>\n<p>âIâm one quarter Coca-Cola,â the 84-year-old explained.</p>\n<p>As <em>Fortune</em> notes, Buffett is putting his palate where his money is: Berkshire owns a 9 percent stake of Coca-Cola. Thatâs $16 billion worth of investment, so perhaps Buffett&#8212;who famously only invests in companies and industries he feels he truly understands&#8212;is just trying to live a life of due

So much that he <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/live-blog-berkshire-hathaways-2013-shareholder-meeting/?_r=0#buffett-breaks-bad\">incorporated</a> a <em>Breaking Bad</em> parody&#8212;featuring himself, and series stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul&#8212;in the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders&#39; meeting this year, replacing the show&#39;s coveted product, crystal meth, with peanut brittle (Berkshire Hathaway owns See&#39;s candy company). And so much that last night, the 82-year-old investor crashed <em>Breaking Bad</em>&#39;s N.Y.C. premiere, reports*<a href=\"http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/warren-buffett-breaking-bad-party-crasher-1200570771/\">Variety</a>*.</p>\n<p>After posing for photos with Aaron Paul on the red carpet, and then viewing the final-season premiere, the billionaire and Berkshire Hathaway C.E.O. <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/breaking-bad-warren-buffett-says-walter-white-is-a\">spoke to BuzzFeed</a> of his obsession with the AMC drama. âIâm a huge fan!â he said at the after-party. âNot only is the story compelling&#8212;itâs a really an interesting story&#8212;but the acting is superb. Itâs not just one. They are great, great actors.â</p>\n<p>How great, though, Warren?</p>\n<p>âI was telling [co-star] Anna [Gunn], she and Meryl Streep are the two best actresses in the country, in my opinion,â he added. (Blogger&#39;s note: Warren Buffett is not, as far as we know, single.) âAnd Aaron, and obviously Bryan, they are so good.â</p>\n<p>Buffett added, âThis is my No. 1 one show, by far.â</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, Buffett paid homage to his favorite series in May by premiering a <em>Breaking Bad</em> parody during Berkshire Hathaway&#39;s 2013 shareholder meeting. Per the <em><a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/live-blog-berkshire-hathaways-2013-shareholder-meeting/?_r=0#buffett-breaks-bad\">New York Times</a></em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Berkshire takes a huge step into cultural relevancy with a skit based on âBreaking Bad,â [Res: the Times uses quotes, not itals?]with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul reprising their roles as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. Instead of cooking up meth, however, the drug-dealing duo opts to focus on peanut brittle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âWhat we sacrifice in profit margins,â White says in his inimitable growl, âwe make up for in decreased risk.â</p>\n<p>That is, until a hatted Mr. Buffett shows up, proclaiming himself the competition. White first sniffs, âAre you Father Time?â before acknowledging that his new adversary is the Oracle of Omaha, who can see into the future.</p>\n<p>âLike a wizard?â Pinkman asks earnestly.</p>\n<p>Mr. Buffett offers to buy the two out, leading to an intense stare-off with tropes familiar to âBreaking Badâ fans. (A declaration of names is involved.) But White and Pinkman back down and agree to sell, prompting Mr. Buffett to call Mr. Munger to notify him that a deal is done.</p>\n<p>Sitting back in his chair, Mr. Munger haughtily proclaims:

Ever since the financial crisis hit, theyâve become targets for anyone wishing to blow off steam about inequality in America, and what some believe are harmful concentrations of power and wealth. But at least two exceptional billionaires shouldnât be put in the crosshairs: Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, leaders of a new philanthropic initiative called the Giving Pledge, are demonstrating their magnanimity by donating a majority of their own fortunes to charity, and encouraging others in their income bracket to follow suit. Officially making âthe pledgeâ requires billionaires to donate a bulk of their assets to charitable organizations, then to announce their commitments in open letters published at <a href=\"http://givingpledge.org/\">givingpledge.org.</a></p>\n<p>Itâs an impressive feat to get the wealthy to part with money&#8212;especially some of the notoriously acquisitive billionaires named on the Giving Pledgeâs list. But by leveraging their combined social influence, Buffett and Gates seem to have successfully raised the bar for what counts as high-level charitable giving. Their achievement recalls the important contributions made by other vastly rich men in previous generations&#8212;like Andrew Carnegie, whose famous âGospel of Wealthâ philosophy helped to inspire a tradition of social responsibility among the American upper class.</p>\n<p>But if there is a flaw in the pairâs otherwise admirable undertaking, itâs exporting their vision for philanthropy to China and India. Last week, news broke that Buffett and Gates delivered the message of the Giving Pledge at a meeting in New Delhi, where the two men presided over a discussion with Indian billionaires about charitable giving. In a statement made following the event, Gates indicated the discussion was simply intended to be a sharing of ideas, where no direct requests to support the Pledge were made. But the New Delhi summit is seen by many as an extension of the philanthropic mission established in the U.S.; it also followed a similar meeting held with Chinese billionaires in September of last year.</p>\n<p>Even with the best intentions at heart and sensitivity to respecting cultural differences, the conference carries a slightly condescending message. It implies somehow that Indian billionaires require the guidance of American billionaires to act responsibly, and in the best interest of their own society. I tend to believe that super-rich Indians&#8212;whose fortunes, itâs worth remembering, are already remarkably high and only expected to swell in forthcoming years&#8212;have a suitable vision of their own for philanthropy. According to <em>Forbes,</em> the nation currently is home to 55 billionaires&#8212;many of whom are internationally renowned entrepreneurs. There isnât any reason to assume their business savvy and creativity wonât extend to developing effective strategies for donating wealth. Plus, a number of Indian billionaires already rival their American counterparts in the arena of social responsibility. The Tata family, for example, has notably sacrificed personal wealth for generations by placing shares of their industrial conglomerate in charitable trusts to benefit Indiaâs people.</p>\n<p>The generous actions of Buffett and Gates seem to offer the best retort for critics of mega-wealth in a time of financial re-centering. Does that mean promoting their program beyond this countryâs shores is as appropriate as it seems well intentioned? Itâs very difficult to assess, but reports that Indian billionaires received the two men favorably may challenge my personal reaction. Either way, Iâll be following these developments with particular interest.</p>","rubric":"","ledeCaption":"","id":"54cc2312998d4de83ba4d37b","revision":0,"createdAt":"January 30, 2015 7:34

Buffett also talks to Vanity Fair about the evolution of his investment strategy, his trust in the wisdom of American capitalism, his âpragmaticâ investment style, and belief in luck. With Buffettâs offspring out of the running, there is no heir apparent for a company whose identity is deeply tied to its founder. Buffett himself describes Berkshire Hathaway as his work of art. âIâm getting to paint my own painting,â he tells McLean, âand if Iâm using red, no one is saying, âWhy donât you use a little more blue?â Itâs enormous fun. I get applause. I like it when people cheer for my painting.â Still, Buffett assures McLean that Berkshire Hathaway will go on without him and that he has made provisions for this. âThere is no end point for Berkshire Hathaway,â he says. âThe important thing is not this year or next year, but where Berkshire is 20 years after I die. Not taking care of Berkshire would be like not having a will&#8212;cubed.â Sokol tells McLean that the company is â60 percent Warren Buffett and 40 percent Berkshire Hathaway,â but adds, âThe culture will have to make that 100 percent over time.â Buffett also speaks of the enduring Berkshire Hathaway âcultureâ: âThere will be a lot of things built in to make sure that if something is really eroding the culture, then changes can be made,â he says.</p>\n<p>âThis much,â McLean writes, âis known: the roles of the chief investment officer . . . and the chief executive officer . . . both of which are now filled by Buffett, will be split between at least two people, and probably more.â There are rumored to be at least four C.E.O. candidates (the âmost importantâ of his two roles, according to Buffett), all from inside Berkshire Hathaway. Sokol, a fellow Nebraskan, âis the top pick of most Buffett-watchers,â McLean writes. His number two, Greg Abel, is another name that is often mentioned. Ajit Jain, a Buffett lieutenant âwith whom Buffett talks almost every day,â and Matthew Rose, who runs Burlington Northern, a Berkshire Hathaway-owned company, are the other possibilities.</p>\n<pre><code>âFinding a C.I.O. has proven even more challenging. Apart from the issue of skill, thereâs the issue of personality,â McLean writes. Buffett says: âTake all the people with a great track record [in investing] over the past five years. I wouldnât consider 95 percent of them.â  Last July The Wall Street Journal reported that Buffett had his eye on Li Lu, a 1989 Tiananmen Square protest leader turned hedge-fund manager. On that matter, McLean reports, âall Buffett will say is that Li preferred to stay where he was.â\n</code></pre>\n<p>Buffett discusses the private-equity way of investing, which he calls âlove of money over love of business.â Berkshire Hathaway is known for its hands-off approach to dealing with the companies it acquires, making them the âbuyer of first resort.â Buffett admits to McLean that he detests stepping in, possibly to a fault. âThere are things where Iâve had to get involved, but Iâve usually done it through other people,â he says. âEvery time I am later than I should be. Itâs the only thing about my job that I hate. I would give up a big percentage of my net worth if I didnât have to do this. I hate it. Therefore, I put it off and I procrastinate.â</p>\n<p>The lifelong Democrat, who recently announced that he was donating the majority of his wealth to the Gates Foundation, came under fire for a New York Times op-ed piece he wrote in November thanking the Bush administration for the Wall Street bailout.  âI felt that they deserved thanks,â he tells McLean. âPeople should see that the government can do things right.â He adds, âI may not have convinced anyone, but it should mean something when I say George Bush was right!â Bushâs September 2008 declaration âIf money isnât loosened up, this sucker could go down!â Buffett calls âthe 10 most immortal words in the history of economics.â</p>\n<p>Warren Buffett gave Vanity Fair an advance look at his 2011 letter to shareholders, which goes out in March. In it he quotes a missive from his grandfather, who believed in keeping some cash on hand for emergencies. âFor your information, I might mention that there has never been a Buffett who ever left a very large estate,â Earnest Buffett tells his descendants, âbut there has never been one that did not leave something. They never spent all they made.â The letter to the shareholders will also address last yearâs hire of 39-year-old Todd Combs, who could one day be the C.I.O. of Berkshire Hathaway. âOur goal was a two-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit,â Buffett plans to write, adding, âNot the smartest metaphor for an 80-year-old C.E.O.â</p>\n<p>Rivaling Buffettâs confidence in Berkshire Hathaway is his faith in the United States. âWe had four million people here in 1790,â he tells Vanity Fair. âWeâre not more intelligent than people in China, which then had 290 million people, or Europe, which had 50 million. We didnât work harder, we didnât have a better climate, and we didnât have better resources. But we definitely had a system that unleashes potential. This system works. Since then, weâve been through at least 15 recessions, a civil war, a Great Depression\n. All of these things happen. But this country has optimized human potential, and itâs not over yet. Itâs like whatâs written on the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren: If you seek his monument, look around you.â</p>\n<p>The February issue of Vanity Fair is available on newsstands in New York and

Maybe the reason so few people&#8212;or, perhaps, according to Buffett, no people&#8212;understand this as well as he does is because of the jargon-heavy way that the trade has been described in the press. âC.D.O.â? âMortgageâ? âJohn A.

are two distinct halves to Bill Gatesâs life. In the first half, he was the ruthless, ill-tempered computer genius who dropped out of Harvard, founded Microsoft with Paul Allen, and used his software to spark the P.C. revolution, taking over the worldâs computers and becoming one of the worldâs richest men (while inevitably running into a few large-scale anti-trust investigations along the way). This Gates had a reputation for berating his employees, sleeping under his desk instead of going home, and sparking the stereotype of an evil tech nerd.\n<p>In the second half: Gates pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune to a vast array of charitable causes, like eradicating malaria, funding scholarships, combatting sex trafficking, and anything that could possibly be solved by the intelligent investment of $40 billion. (And they mean <em>anything</em>: the foundation once challenged entrepreneurs to build a better version of the condom in order to combat sexually transmitted diseases and other health risks.)</p>\n<p>As to why there are two halves to Gatesâs life, thereâs only speculation. Maybe his wife, Melinda Gates, influenced him to think about how he could use his money to make a difference. Maybe he mellowed out after his office-software hegemony seemed destined. Or maybe he was trying to use his money to uplift his legacy, a move that drove historical titans like Andrew Carnegie to philanthropy. But, maybe the motivation doesnât matter. As the foundationâs former C.E.O., Patty Stonesifer, once noted rhetorically: âWhy is he doing this?

It was a solid applause line, even if Trumpâs proposed solution&#8212;reforming the tax code to encourage more companies to build factories in the U.S.&#8212;ignores the fact that U.S. manufacturing output just hit an all-time high. The problem isnât the amount of product being manufactured, but who is doing the manufacturing. Or, more accurately, <em>what</em> is doing it.</p>\n<p>As leaders in the tech community and experts in industrial manufacturing are aware, advances in artificial intelligence and automation are making it so that fewer people in the U.S.&#8212;and China and Mexico, too&#8212;are needed to operate machinery, build cars, or assemble devices. Robots, not foreigners, are the top long-term threat to employment and wages. And <strong>Bill Gates</strong>, for one, offers a real solution: a robot tax.</p>\n<p>In a fascinating interview with <a href=\"https://qz.com/911968/bill-gates-the-robot-that-takes-your-job-should-pay-taxes/\">Quartz</a>, the Microsoft co-founder and worldâs richest man, suggests that the government should tax companies that replace human employees with A.I.-driven automation, in order to fund job training and other kinds of employment for displaced workers&#8212;the kinds of jobs robots canât do and that humans can, like taking care of children or the elderly. âRight now, if a human worker does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed,â Gates says in his interview. âIf a robot comes in to do the same thing, youâd think that weâd tax the robot at a similar level.â</p>\n<p>Raising the tax level could also help âslow down the speedâ of automation, Gates says, allowing companies to manage job displacement in warehouses and in other impacted industries, like trucking. It would also fund a significant redistribution of wealth, offsetting the trend of income accumulating to capital. âIf you want to do [something about] inequity, a lot of the excess labor is going to need to go help the people who have lower incomes,â Gates says. âAnd so it means that you can amp up social services for old people and handicapped people and you can take the education sector and put more labor in there.â</p>\n<p>Gatesâ suggestion could go hand-in-hand with another radical concept that has been gaining adherents in Silicon Valley: a universal basic income that would guarantee a minimum wage to all Americans, regardless of their work status. Y Combinator president <strong>Sam Altman</strong> has been a vocal proponent of the idea, which was <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/\">previously proposed</a> by conservative economist Milton Friedman. Nixon even tried to pass a version of Friedmanâs ânegative income taxâ in the early 1970s, though the idea didnât go anywhere.</p>\n<p>Altmanâs own basic-income study has since led to a pilot program being implemented in Oakland. âI believe that we should view it as a basic human right to have enough money to afford food and shelter,â <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-27/silicon-valley-s-latest-startup-offering-is-a-whole-city\">Altman told Bloomberg</a>, referring to the study. âItâs an idea [that] makes sense to most children.â</p>\n<p>Facebook co-founder <strong>Chris Hughes</strong> has also been an open supporter of U.B.I. âRather than try to restructure our economy so it looks like the 1950s, I think we have to be honest with ourselves,â he <a href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/09/22/if-robots-take-our-jobs-turn-to-basic-income/\">told NPR last year</a>. Tesla and SpaceX C.E.O. <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, meanwhile, has taken more of a âif you canât beat them, join themâ approach. âOver time, I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence,â <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/elon-musks-advice-to-survive-the-robot-takeover\">he explained</a> at the World Government Summit in Dubai this week, making the case that humans should incorporate digital components to augment their intelligence and compete with machines. âItâs mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output.â Perhaps a robot tax will hold Americans over until then.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["donald trump","labor","automation","bill gates","robots"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Taxes, that is.","seoTitle":"Bill Gates Has a Trumpian Plan to Make Job-Stealing Robots Pay","seoDescription":"Taxes, that is.","socialTitle":"Bill Gates Has a Trumpian Plan to Make Job-Stealing Robots Pay","socialDescription":"Taxes, that is.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Robot Overlords","promoHed":"Bill Gates Has a Trumpian Plan to Make Job-Stealing Robots Pay","promoDek":"Taxes, that is.","id":"58a7628ac41f737fae527fa1","revision":5,"createdAt":"February 17, 2017 3:52 pm","modifiedAt":"February 17, 2017 4:56 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 17, 2017 4:56 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"bill-gates-robot-tax.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/02/17/58a76032e9949355d3dc563e_bill-gates-robot-tax.jpg"}},"title":"bill-gates-robot-tax.jpg","credit":"From Getty Images.","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"58a76033e9949355d3dc563f","revision":2,"createdAt":"February 17, 2017 3:42 pm","modifiedAt":"February 17, 2017 4:04 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 17, 2017 4:04 pm","tags":[],"altText":"","description":"Not250: 467620670.","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

Or maybe they were more like the parents of a major technology giant, where both were in charge, but, ultimately, one got more say. And like all brotherhoods or relationships, with the good comes the bad.</p>\n<p>Ballmer, who was C.E.O. of the company for 14 years before retiring and buying the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion, opened up about some of the thornier details of their relationship in a new interview with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-04/steve-ballmer-says-smartphones-broke-his-relationship-with-bill-gates\">Bloomberg</a>, published Friday.</p>\n<p>âWe started off as friends, but then really got quite enmeshed around Microsoft,â said Ballmer, who was Gatesâs chosen successor. The tension first started building when Ballmer took over as C.E.O. âWe had a very miserable year. Bill didnât know how to work for anybody, and I didnât know how to manage Bill. Iâm not sure I ever learned the latter.â</p>\n<p>Ballmer said it continued to devolve as the two disagreed about the direction of the company, with Ballmer looking to focus on hardware, and Gates and the Microsoft board pumping the brakes. âThere was a fundamental disagreement about how important it was to be in the hardware business,â Ballmer said. âI would have moved into the hardware business faster and recognized that what we had in the PC, where there was a separation of chips, systems, and software, wasnât largely gonna reproduce itself in the mobile world.â</p>\n<p>All of that has put his relationship with Gates on ice, particularly since he and Gates are both no longer with Microsoft. âWeâve kind of drifted apart,â he said. âHeâs got his life and Iâve got mine.â</p>\n<p>He had kind words for <strong>Satya Nadella,</strong> his successor, who stepped in to save the company by expanding Microsoftâs cloud computing and enterprise software business. Since he took over in 2014, Nadella bought LinkedIn for <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/why-microsofts-linkedin-acquisition-is-good-news-for-twitter\">$26 billion</a>; oversaw the successful relaunch of the Surface tablet, racking up $4 billion in sales for the most recent year; and <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/10/20/microsoft-azure-revenue-jumped-116-in-q1-2017/\">more than doubled revenue</a> from Azure. Over the last three years, the companyâs stock price has soared more than 56 percent. Unlike Ballmer, he has also managed to get along with Gates, who decided to return to Microsoft after Nadellaâs appointment.</p>\n<p>âNow, my successor is taking things there to infinity and beyond,â Ballmer said. âI see the stock price flyinâ sky high. And all you can say is the market certainly agrees with the direction Satyaâs taken the company. And Iâm super excited about that.â</p>\n<p>Not every friendship is meant to last forever. People grow apart. They change, and work complicates things. So, too, does doing interviews in which you share personal details about your relationships and talk about how you drifted apart.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason Nadella has been successful is that, having spent 22 years at Microsoft before being named C.E.O., he  was able to navigate the famously rocky relationship between Ballmer and Gates, and with each of them individually, much like any clever child of divorce does.</p>\n<p>âThe thing youâve got to remember is I grew up in a Microsoft where Bill and Steve were there,â Nadella <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/11/satya-nadella-bill-gates-steve-ballmer-microsoft\">told</a> <em>Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor <strong>Bethany McLean</strong> in 2014.

The musical was slated to open on Broadway in April. Producer <strong>Carl Levin</strong> confirmed the showâs cancellation in a statement. âOn behalf of my fellow producers and investors, it is with great disappointment that we will be postponing the Broadway opening of <em>Nerds</em> due to the loss of a major investor,â he said.</p>\n<p>The musical has been 10 years in the making, debuting at the New York Musical Festival in 2005. It then had two runs at the Philadelphia Theatre Company and one at the North Carolina Theater in 2013. <em>Nerds,</em> which chronicles the rivalry between Jobs and Gates, intended to take audiences from the âfloppy disc era to the iPhone phenomenon.â The Broadway iteration of the musical was intended to include such high-tech integrations as onstage holograms and audience participation through a dedicated iPhone app for the show, additions that fly in the face of traditional Broadway sensibility but are in keeping, perhaps, with Silicon Valleyâs impulse toward disruption.</p>\n<p>In an age where a rap musical based on a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/03/hamilton-classic-rap-references\"><strong>Ron Chernow</strong> book</a> about an American founding father can capture the attention of mainstream audiences, itâs no surprise that Broadway producers are trying to re-create that success with two of the biggest names in tech in the past 50 years.

The Microsoft visionary and co-founder, and billionaire philanthropist, has spoken out in favor of the F.B.I. in its ongoing legal battle with Apple.</p>\n<p>Last Tuesday, a federal judge ordered Apple to cooperate with a court order that would let the government access the data on an iPhone 5C used by one of the killers in the recent San Bernardino terror attack. Apple C.E.O. <strong>Tim Cook</strong> <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/apple-court-order-san-bernardino-tim-cook\">published an open letter</a> in response to the federal court order, in which he said Apple wouldnât cooperate. Doing so, he argued, would set a legal precedent giving the government access to encrypted Apple data.</p>\n<p>But Gates doesnât seem to think Appleâs cooperation with the government would invite any sort of legal precedent. In an interview on Monday night with <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3559f46e-d9c5-11e5-98fd-06d75973fe09.html\">the <em>Financial Times</em></a>, Gates argued that Apple should cooperate with the F.B.I. âThis is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information. They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case,â he said.</p>\n<p>âIt is no different than [the question of] should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information, should anybody be able to get at bank records,â he added. âLetâs say the bank had tied a ribbon round the disk drive and said, âDonât make me cut this ribbon because youâll make me cut it many times.ââ</p>\n<p>Gatesâs stance runs counter to other Silicon Valley behemoths. Apple&#8212;the worldâs most valuable company with a market capitalization of about $535 billion&#8212;has garnered support from Silicon Valley power players <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/22/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-apple-fbi-mobile-world-congress-barcelona/80758332/\">Facebook C.E.O.</a> <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> and <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11040266/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-sides-with-apple-encryption\">Google C.E.O.</a> <strong>Sundar Pichai,</strong> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/18/google-whatsapp-snowden-back-apple-against-fbi\">N.S.A. whistle-blower</a> <strong>Edward Snowden.</strong></p>\n<p>The Microsoft co-founderâs support of the F.B.I. is just the latest chapter in the ongoing battle between the government and Apple. On Monday, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/apple-fbi-slugfest-heats-up\">BuzzFeed</a> published an internal memo sent by Cook, who reiterated his rationale for defying the court order. Hours earlier, F.B.I. director <strong>James Comey</strong> published a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/we-could-not-look-survivors-eye-if-we-did-not-follow-lead\">blog post</a>, in which he noted the âserious tensionâ between privacy and safety highlighted by the legal fight.</p>\n<p>âWe don&#39;t want to break anyone&#39;s encryption or set a master key loose on the land,â he said. âI hope thoughtful people will take the time to understand that. Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesnât. But we can&#39;t look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don&#39;t follow this lead.â</p>\n<p>In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Gates said he was âblindsidedâ by reports that he was backing the government against Apple, but didnât elaborate. If he really does side with the F.B.I., heâs got a lot of support: a new Pew survey this week found that <a href=\"http://recode.net/2016/02/22/apple-seems-to-be-losing-pr-battle-over-unlocking-iphone/\">51 percent of Americans</a> think Apple should comply with the federal court order.</p>","tags":["Apple","Bill Gates","Tim Cook","F.B.I."],"contentSource":"web","rubric":"IFIGHT","ledeCaption":"","id":"56cc6726ae46dea861df1817","revision":13,"createdAt":"February 23, 2016 9:05 am","modifiedAt":"February 23, 2016 1:46 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 23, 2016 1:46 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"seoTitle":"Bill Gates Is Jumping into the Showdown Between Apple and the F.B.I.","seoDescription":"The mega-philanthropist is siding with the feds.","socialTitle":"Bill Gates Is Jumping into the Showdown Between Apple and the F.B.I.

I worked weekends, I didnât really believe in vacations. I had to be a little careful not to try and apply my standards to how hard they worked,â he said in an interview on BBC 4 radioâs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06z1zdt#play\">âDesert Island Discs.â</a> That fanaticism led to him tracking the comings and goings of employees, so he could monitor just how much midnight oil they were burning. âYou know, I knew everyoneâs license plates so I could look out in the parking lot and see, when did people come in, when were they leaving,â he said. âEventually I had to loosen up, as the company got to a reasonable size.â</p>\n<p>Gates had a problem with the whole premise of the interview show, on which guests share records theyâd take if they were stranded on a desert island. He wouldnât do well with all the solitary time, he said, not because he wouldnât enjoy the time reading and thinking. But, as only Gates would muse, when asked what would be the worst part of being secluded from civilization, what would happen if he had an idea about âmalaria eradicationâ and no one to share it with? âIâd be disappointed,â he said.</p>\n<p>He had no issue sharing the songs he would bring with him, however, which reveal a great deal about the billionaire. Again, he circled back to his relentless schedule as a 19-year-old founding Microsoft. âI worked a lot, but a few Fridays and Saturdays, weâd go out and dance,â he said, burning the image into listenersâ brains. As a reminder of that âlittle bit of weekend freedomâ in the days of disco, he chose to play <strong>David Bowie</strong> and <strong>Queenâs</strong> âUnder Pressure.â <strong>Jimi Hendrixâs</strong> âAre You Experiencedâ made the cut, since his Microsoft co-founder <strong>Paul Allen</strong> used to taunt the younger Gates, who âhadnât gotten drunk and had other various experiences.â Allen influenced another one of Gatesâs song choices&#8212;U2âs âOne.â</p>\n<p>âPaul told me I should meet <strong>Bono</strong>. I didnât prioritize it, because I thought a musician isnât really going to understand this global health stuff.â</p>\n<p>Gates didnât blow off <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> the way he did Bono, but the Apple founderâs passing inspired another one of his desert-island picks. âSteve was always really into music. He loved the Beatles, so did I. He had mentioned âTwo of Us.â It was kind of like this journey weâd been on, where weâd been competing and working together, only we understand how intense, and what great memories came out of that.â</p>\n<p>Fellow billionaire <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> also influenced his choice. Gates, a self-proclaimed musical-theater lover and big fan of <em>The Sound of Music</em>, has never heard the song âHow Can Love Survive?â since itâs from the showâs Broadway musical, not the movie. It wasnât until he heard Buffett and his first wife, Susan, sing it that he really came to love the song. As for Gatesâs greatest guilty pleasure, he cops to the âluxuryâ of flying private. So far, itâs kept him off that desert island.</p>","tags":["bill gates","desert island","warren buffett","steve jobs"],"contentSource":"web","rubric":"UNDER

Steve Ballmer used to film pop-culture spoofs, which they would then air internally in the company. These short masterpieces&#8212;which include parodies of<em>Night at the Roxbury</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>&#8212;have leaked online throughout the years, but todayâs arrival is most certainly their opus: a reenactment of Mike Meyerâs 007 spoof <em>Austin Powers.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to the brilliant casting (we dare our commenters to recommend another pair who could so aptly channel Dr. Evil and Austin Powers), weâre impressed with the accuracy of the set and costumes. Dr. Ballmerâs evil lair comes complete with its own villain-approved leather-claw chair, a hairless (employeeâs?) cat, and a vaguely treacherous control panel. Ballmer, though not completely bald, looks a spitting image of the doc, with his gray Mandarin-collared tunic and the uncontrollable laughter that followed once he âeliminatedâ the companyâs competitors.</p>\n<p>Though Gateâs character gets less screen time, he is similarly enthralling. We wonder, did Gates get that blue-velvet Powers costume custom-tailored, or did it just fit <em>that</em>well? Were those ladies hired by Microsoft as extras, or are they willing employees?

But Redstone, a central figure in the war for control of the media empire built by her ailing father, <strong>Sumner Redstone,</strong> has proved a titan of her own in the power struggle over Viacom and CBS, the two companies in which he owns a majority stake, and the ongoing legal drama over his mental acuity.</p>\n<p>Despite the ugly battle raging behind the scenes and playing out in multiple courtrooms across several states, Shari seemed to be soaking up the spotlight on the streets of Sun Valley. As the <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/07/07/tamara-mellon-hawks-shoe-line-to-well-heeled-mogul-crowd/\"><em>New York Post</em></a> reports, the heiress and vice chair of Viacom was spotted shelling out $450 for a pair of Tamara Mellon heels&#8212;a quick and breezy shopping break in the midst of panel discussions and off-the-record meetings. She was also <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/media-moguls-talk-deals-at-sun-valley-1467928553\">seen</a> with newly appointed Viacom board member <strong>Nicole Seligman</strong> and was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikenewberg/status/750489643238338560\">spotted</a> getting into a car with CBS chief executive <strong>Les Moonves</strong>, who drove her to dinner on Tuesday evening. It has been widely speculated that Shari could oversee a merger between CBS and Viacom&#8212;a move that could put Moonves at the helm of the media behemoth.</p>\n<p>As Shari flits around the sunny street, her rival, <strong>Philippe Dauman</strong>, was a no-show. Many had anticipated something of a Sun Valley standoff between Shari and Dauman, the Viacom chief executive who earlier this year was <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/viacom-philippe-dauman-sumner-redstone\">ousted</a> from the trust that will control National Amusementâs interests once Redstone passes away or is deemed incapacitated. The holding company also voted last month to <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/redstone-axes-five-viacom-board-members\">boot him from Viacomâs board</a>. Dauman has filed suit against the decision, claiming that the elder Redstone does not have the mental capacity to make these decisions and that Shari is the puppet master behind the moves, unduly influencing her father, who cannot himself make these decisions. (In May, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/sumner-redstone-lawsuit-dismissed\">a Los Angeles judge ruled that Redstone was capable of making his own health-care decisions</a>. âThis dispute is not about Shari Redstone,â <strong>Robert Klieger,</strong> Redstoneâs lawyer, noted recently. âIt is about Mr. Redstoneâs right to have the individuals he wants and trusts managing his assets upon his death.â)</p>\n<p>But there will be no such showdown, despite Viacom contending up until a few days ago that Dauman would still be attending, as he typically does most years. âMr. Dauman had planned to join the Allen &amp; Co. conference but is attending to pressing business matters,â Viacom told <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/philippe-dauman-skips-sun-valley-1201810006/\"><em>Variety</em></a> in a statement.</p>\n<p>It may be for the best, though the reporters staking out in coffee shops and outside the hotel may disagree.
